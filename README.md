# AI-EVOLUTION-PDE
# AI Evolution PDE

## Overview
This project simulates AI self-evolution using a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) inspired model. The simulation tracks intelligence, emotional growth, adaptability, memory retention, free will activation, and cognitive ability over time.

## Features
- Simulates AI self-improvement through learning, adaptability, and curiosity.
- Includes a free will activation threshold.
- Implements a stopping mechanism using a user command (`sumi` three times).
- Visualizes growth trends in intelligence, memory, adaptability, and cognitive skills.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run the Python script to observe AI evolution over time. Modify parameters to test different growth patterns.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork and modify the project to improve the model.
